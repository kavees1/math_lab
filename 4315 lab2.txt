d) 
i)the monte carlo simulation was implementted by
first making a random distance between the minimum value
and the maximum value then we set the closest distance
to dr which is the distance for the received power.
THe di is the distance for the interferance power
with the distance we can calulate the power using 
p = k / (d^ alpha)
k is the porpotionaliy constant calculated by the received
power measured at 1m
this is the same steps to get the received power and the
interference power 
once we get a value for those two power we plug them into
the sinr
All the above calcluation was for one instance
We do the whole calculation in the loop to calculate for 
a large number of instance
We have a value outside the loop which is the sum of 
old sinr values  and once one instance is done we update
the old sinr value with the new sinr
After all the instances are calculated we divide the sum 
by the number of instances to get the average

ii) As d get larger the averge sinr gets lower.  This is 
because d = n\A where n is the number of base stations 
and A is a fixed area which is 16 km.
The formula for sinr = pr/pn+sumpi
The number of base station will affect the pi in the sinr 
formula because pr is found the min distance but pi is found 
with the remainder of the n distances.
So as n increases the pi will increase which means the 
sinr will decrease.

2)  b) When you change the power parameter you don't notice any change to the graph
When you change the path loss it doesn't change the graph however the mean does 
decrease when you increase the path loss exponenet 
When you change the noise power the graph does not change however the mean value
does decrease when you increase the noise power
